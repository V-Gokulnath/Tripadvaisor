I'm excited to share that I’ve completed the frontend level of my TripAdvisor project using HTML & CSS! 🌍💻

Through this journey, I honed my skills in:

✅ Structuring web pages with semantic HTML

✅ Styling with CSS for responsive and visually appealing design

✅ Improving UI/UX to enhance user experience

This project was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge and bring ideas to life. Looking forward to adding more functionality and diving deeper into interactivity!

Each step of this project reinforced my passion for frontend development. 🚀 Excited to keep learning, improve interactivity, and explore JavaScript next!
